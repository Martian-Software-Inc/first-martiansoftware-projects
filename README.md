# Martian Software's First Projects

[Martian Software](https://martiansoftware.com) was around for a long time before I created [its GitHub organization](https://github.com/Martian-Software-Inc).  This repository links to the projects that predate this org.  They are still Martian Software projects, but for various reasons I do not want to move them from their original homes under [my personal GitHub account](https://github.com/martylamb/).

## Current(ish) Projects

Some of these have been around for a while but remain useful.

1. **[atomicfileoutputstream](https://github.com/martylamb/atomicfileoutputstream)**  
A drop-in `FileOutputStream` replacement for java that performs all-or-nothing file overwrites to ensure data integrity.

2. **[blobstore](https://github.com/martylamb/blobstore)**  
A simple java API for providing a content-addressable, local disk-backed data store.

3. **[hope and doubt](https://github.com/martylamb/hope-and-doubt)**  
A tiny validation library for java that provides both optimistic (hope) and pessimistic (doubt) validation, throwing unchecked and checked validation exceptions, respectively.

4. **[macnificent](https://github.com/martylamb/macnificent)**  
Utility classes for working with MAC addresses and IEEE OUI registry information in java.

5. **[martian-hex](https://github.com/martylamb/martian-hex)**  
A simple java library for converting binary data to and from hexadecimal in a variety of formats.  

6. **[martian-log](https://github.com/martylamb/martian-log)**  
Simple extensions for slf4j that provide additional functionality and ergonomics.

7. **[tictac](https://github.com/martylamb/tictac)**
